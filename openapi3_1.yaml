        This endpoint works in the same way as the
        [operation/searchBusinesses](https://developers.partoo.co/rest_api/v2/#operation/searchBusinesses)
        endpoint, but instead of returning data on all returned businesses, this
        endpoint returns completion rate statistics aggregated across all
        businesses.


        The statistics returned are the average completion rate for all
        businesses that fit the given filters, as well as the count of
        businesses with a low, medium, and high respectively. The thresholds for
        low, medium, and high can be found below in the response details.


        Note that this endpoint works in the exact same way as
        [operation/searchBusinesses](https://developers.partoo.co/rest_api/v2/#operation/searchBusinesses)
        (with the exception of parameters that format the output, such as
        <code>order_by</code> and pagination), but the return value is
        different.

      summary: Profile metrics for your business
      description: >
        This endpoint lets you view the **Google Business Profile** analytics
        for all your businesses subscribed to

        **Presence Management**.

        The API allows you to select what data you're interested in, and how you
        want it aggregated (daily, monthly,

        by business, etc). You can also filter the results to limit it to a
        certain date range, and to certain business.


        Google Business Profile doesn't provide reliable data for the most
        recent 5 days.


        You can choose the analytics you want to get among:

        - impressions: desktop maps impressions, mobile maps impressions,
        desktop search impressions, and mobile search impressions

        - actions: website link clicks, phone calls, and driving directions


        You can use the following filters:

        - by businesses (businesses id in list or not in list)

        - by date (analytics before and/or after a date)

        - by business query. Will return matches for the business name, zipcode
        or city

        - by business city.


        The response can be aggregated by:

        - business id

        - by date: either by day, week, month or year

        - by both business id and date


        The response can be ordered in ascending or descending order by any of
        the selected dimensions or metrics.

        See examples for more details.

         To use an **order_by** parameter, its corresponding metric must be included in the request.
         (i.e.
         to order by `average_rating`, you must include the `average_rating` metric in the `metrics` parameter,
         to order by `ratio__rating_distribution__5`, you must include the `rating_distribution` metric in the `metrics` parameter,
         and so on...)

        <p>The More Hours of the business and category (in its timezone).

        <p>More hours are specified per weekday. This is done by supplying a
        More Hour ID (<code>BREAKFAST</code>, <code>DINNER</code>, etc.), and an
        object mapping weekdays (<code>monday</code>, <code>tuesday</code>,
        etc.) to a list of of strings. These strings in turn represent time
        slots during which the business is open.

        <p>For example, the following value would set the kitchen hours to
        between 08:00-15:00 in the afternoon and 18:00-23:00 in the evening on
        Mondays:

        <p><code>{"gmb_id": "KITCHEN", "value": {"monday": ["08:00-15:00",
        "18:00-23:00"]}}</code>

        <p>To indicate that a business is open 24 hours for a specific weekday,
        use the value <code>["00:00-23:59"]</code>.

        <p>To delete a More Hours value, supply a <code>null</code> value.

        The chat hours of the business (in its timezone).


        Chat hours are specified per weekday. This is done by supplying an
        object

        mapping weekdays ("monday", "tuesday", etc.) to a list of strings. These

        strings in turn represent time slots during which the business is open.


        For example, the following value would set the chat hours to between

        08:00-15:00 in the afternoon and 18:00-23:00 in the evening on Mondays:


        <code>{"monday": ["08:00-15:00", "18:00-23:00"]}</code>


        To indicate that a business can be contacted for 24 hours, for a
        specific

        weekday, use the value <code>["00:00-23:59"]</code>.

      description: |
        Some messaging channels (Google and Facebook) can be temporarily
        deactivated. This allows the business to close for a period of time
        without having to answer consumer messages.

        This is important because consumers will get frustrated if they are able
        to contact a business and do not get an answer. It is also important to
        note that for some messaging channels, not responding to messages may
        lead to decreased visibility of the business, or suspension of the
        messaging service.

        The is_launched property indicates whether the business is reachable
        for those messaging channels.

        The value can be updated, and the changes will be propagated to the
        messaging channels, effectively toggling the On or Off the ability for
        consumers to reach the business. (The change to "is_launched" is made
        asychronously, and the update will be effective when the messaging
        channels have finished propagating the information)

        Placeholders are recognisable within the text by this exact markup
        `@[](name_of_the_placeholder)`.

        Where `name_of_the_placeholder` is the `value` field taken from the `GET
        placeholders` operation.


        Example of usable placeholder values: `client_full_name`,
        `client_first_name`, `business_name`, `my_first_name`.
      type: string
      example: |-
        hello @[](client_full_name),

        ⚠️ Deprecated, please use the [New Message
        Created](#operation/message_created) webhook instead, and filter on
         `sender_type=Consumer` and `status=Success` to reproduce this webhook comportement.

        This event is triggered when a business receives a new message sent by a

        Consumer.

        It is not triggered for messages sent as the business by a User.


        The event payload contains the event type, the content of the message

        received, and additional information about the conversation.

      description: >
        This event is triggered if the field of a message is updated (example:
        `status`, `is_deleted`).


        Messages send via Partoo are created with the status `Sending`, and

        propagated to the messaging channel.

        If the message is sent successfully, the status is changed to `Success`.

        If the messaging channel fails to send the message, the status changed
        to

        `Failed`. A failed message can be retried using the [/retry
        endpoint](#operation/retrySendMessage).


        The event payload contains the event type, the content of the updated
        message and additional information about the conversation.
